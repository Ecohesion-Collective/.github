## Welcome to [Ecohesion](https://www.ecohesion.it/en/)! 

We are a research group at the University of Pisa that studies the interactions between climate policies, economic transformations, and redistributive mechanisms.

In our repositories you’ll find the main files that support the group’s collaborative work — in particular, the repository for the [Eurogreen](https://github.com/Ecohesion-Collective/Eurogreen) model — along with public replication materials for our research papers.

As a member of the Ecohesion Collective, you’ll find here the key guidelines for working together and sharing your research via GitHub.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
